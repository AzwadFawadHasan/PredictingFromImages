# why we need to do normalization (preprocessing of input data)
Normalization is a technique where we adjust the input data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (or scale the data to a specific range like 0 to 1). 
- to ensure that the neurons of the neural network are fed with a consistent range of data [0-1] ( consistent range means training process of model is more stable)
- without normalization some features might dominate other features due to their scale, also normalization helps algorithms like gradient descent to perform more efficeintly
- This allows for faster convergence of the model, meaning the model will be more accurate with less no of epoch training
